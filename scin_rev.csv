Disappointed but still had hope so called up voice customer care, the guy was quick enough to give a toll free helpline number which turned out to be for Securities only. After 3 years with SC, this is the first time I think about moving my account to another one. Investing in Mutual Fund via SC seems be a dream now. 

It seem they have invested all their money in Anushka Sharma‚Äôs ad campaign instead of customer support.
