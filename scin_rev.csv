After the “so called” useless aesthetic updates, the app always crashes. Not even once I could use it. The credit card bill payment is pathetic.

"35","No support for Mutual Fund","https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id657883025","Life's an illusion","5.0.3","1","We cannot start investing in Mutual fund online. You are forced to visit the bank. Bank representative is least interested in explaining Mutual Fund they will bombard you with Term insurance or big investment plans. Less / no support from Bank representatives. Disappointed but still had hope so called up voice customer care, the guy was quick enough to give a toll free helpline number which turned out to be for Securities only. After 3 years with SC, this is the first time I think about moving my account to another one. Investing in Mutual Fund via SC seems be a dream now. 

It seem they have invested all their money in Anushka Sharma’s ad campaign instead of customer support. 

Pathetic!!!",2018-07-16 08:59:06
