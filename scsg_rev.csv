It has all the important info we need to check from time to time, such as, 1.Available limit, 2. Payment due date etc. Do we really need to click into the transaction history of the card before we can check all the info regarding the card details? Can we not make the button accessible right beside the card after login?",2018-10-20 06:28:53

"34","Suggestions","https://itunes.apple.com/sg/reviews/id100866097","Sallywhy","7.1.1","3","Was automatically converted to receiving electronic statements instead of my usual paper statements for a few months now.

1) had a hard time submitting claims to my company for specific monthly spendings. Reason being my name did not appear together with the transaction(s). Tried both app and web version of statements but both versions did not list my name together with the transaction. Will be unable to submit my claims without this. Please change this and fast. Else i’d be forced to use the service of other banks instead.

2) Had a really difficult time searching through the app just to view my monthly statements. Suggest to make this easier if you want us users to stick with using electronic statements.

3) 60 days worth of transaction history is totally insufficient. Hope it will get increased to 12 months, or the bare minimum of 6 months.

4) option to receive paper or electronic monthly statements.
This option was not included in your app. Hope it will get included in your new version.

Thanks.",2018-08-31 08:55:23
