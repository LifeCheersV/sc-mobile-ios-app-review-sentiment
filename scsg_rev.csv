"Card details should be made more accessible!","https://itunes.apple.com/sg/reviews/id123450042","msTough","7.1.5","1","Can we just agree that the card detail that requires so many clicks to access just simply does not make any sense???

It has all the important info we need to check from time to time, such as, 1.Available limit, 2. Payment due date etc. Do we really need to click into the transaction history of the card before we can check all the info regarding the card details? Can we not make the button accessible right beside the card after login?",2018-10-20 06:28:53

"Suggestions","https://itunes.apple.com/sg/reviews/id100866097","Sallywhy","7.1.1","3","Was automatically converted to receiving electronic statements instead of my usual paper statements for a few months now.

1) had a hard time submitting claims to my company for specific monthly spendings. Reason being my name did not appear together with the transaction(s). Tried both app and web version of statements but both versions did not list my name together with the transaction. Will be unable to submit my claims without this. Please change this and fast. Else i’d be forced to use the service of other banks instead.

2) Had a really difficult time searching through the app just to view my monthly statements. Suggest to make this easier if you want us users to stick with using electronic statements.

3) 60 days worth of transaction history is totally insufficient. Hope it will get increased to 12 months, or the bare minimum of 6 months.

4) option to receive paper or electronic monthly statements.
This option was not included in your app. Hope it will get included in your new version.

Thanks.",2018-08-31 08:55:23

However the app does keep logging off after a couple of actions, be it approving a log-on or a new payer etc. 

After I have been away for a while it may also prompt that the device configuration has changed and require a mobile key registration again. This, while I am certain that I did not change any of the app configuration. 

Also, when authorising a new payee or transfer, I need to prompt the system via my PC browser twice before I get to the mobile key screen on my app. A minor bugbear but it should be sorted out.",2018-04-29 08:39:29

I would suggest all to update to the latest version and also to keep you iPhone up to date. People are complying about not being able to see the due date and no reminder. This is your responsibility.

Pretty impressive UI although I question the need to see your records without logging in. It's a fancy feature if you have nothing much better to update already but compared to the fact that until today statements are still hidden instead of being easily accessible (maybe see how citi does it?), this should have been wayyyyyy below the to-do list.

Also the confirmation bar is the old one! Very ugly la Aiyo. Nonetheless, keep moving towards this direction and I'm sure you guys will catchup with the top dogs soon. Until then, 3.5 stars!",2018-04-24 11:47:16

The transfer interface is on a separate interface now which slows down the selection of accounts and therefore the whole process of transferring funds.

In addition, after several months of the IPhone X launch, SCB is still unable to fully utilize the full screen capabilities of the iPhone X.

If every other bank in the street is able to update their app timely and to provide a seamless transfer of funds interface. Why can’t SCB??? I not asking for you to top the competition, but please, just at least follow the pack.",2018-01-15 16:00:11
