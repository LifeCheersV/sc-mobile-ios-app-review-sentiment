In the latest version, I could not even log in because the app failed to issue me a new “SC Mobile Key”.  I have visited the bank and verified my identity and phone number but it still didn’t work. Experiencing so much trouble, I decide to cut my account at this stupid bank altogether. 

Last review:
The new features claimed in the latest update, namely allowing users to use FaceID and add credit cards to Wallet, do not work at all! FaceID cannot be activated whether the app was recovered from my old phone or the app was deleted and re-downloaded. It also doesn’t work even following SC’s suggestion on their website (switch to Yes to No then Yes? It’s still NO!). I have called the hotline twice and they offer no better solutions. When trying to add cards to Wallet from the app, it asks users to wait for a SMS verification code that NEVER comes. The bank is wasting money on lousy app developer.",2018-10-10 09:00:46
